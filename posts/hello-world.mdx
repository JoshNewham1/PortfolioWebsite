Hey there, I'm Josh, a software developer with around three years of experience working with Power BI and the Power Platform ðŸ‘‹

I've been saved by a fair few of blog posts over the years and thought it was finally time to start my own to help out others
just as [CrossJoin](https://blog.crossjoin.co.uk/), [SQLBI](https://www.sqlbi.com/articles/) and the [Microsoft Forums](https://powerusers.microsoft.com/t5/Forums/ct-p/PA_Comm_Forums)
have helped me.

I'll be discussing anything that takes my fancy in the world of tech and beyond. To start with, it's likely to be the quirky and _"interesting"_ approaches I've taken when
getting things working day-to-day in the Microsoft ecosystem. So if any of the below interests and/or frustrates you, stick around!

I've got no release schedule planned, but **I'll post on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josh-n-688619189/)** whenever a new blog post is released,
so follow me there to keep up-to-date.

Happy devving in the meantime!
